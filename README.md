# score.js

A small javascript module to add levels, checkpoints and badges to a linear score. 

See the [demo](http://mulhoon.github.io/score.js/) or read an [introduction](https://medium.com/@mulhoon/easy-gamification-in-javascript-with-levelup-js-8ff3b67e7706)

## Installation
Install with npm, pnpm or yarn.
```bash
pnpm i @mulhoon/score.js
```

## Quick usage
```javascript
var score = new Score();

// set score
score.set(123);

// increase score by 1
score.increment();

// increase score by 10
score.increment(10);

// decrease score by 1
score.decrement();

// get scorecard
score.scorecard();
```
scorecard returns...
```javascript
{
	score:123						// current total score
	title:"Gorilla",				// current title
	quote:"You're a true soldier"	// current quote
	level:2,						// current level
	levelscore:23,					// current level score
	leveltotal:200,					// current level total
	levelprogress:11.51, 			// percentage %
	totalprogress:34.45, 			// percentage %
	levelup: false,					// did we just level up?
	totallevels:10 					// total levels
	prestige:0 						// prestige level see below
}
```
```lib/score.js``` comes with 10 levels as default. ```lib/score-basic.js``` comes with none. The default levels can be replaced with custom levels using the setup below.

## Setup


```javascript
var score = new Score(
	{
		persistant:true				// uses localStorage -  default: true
		callback:function(){...}	// callback when levelling up
		levels: 					// custom levels
		[							
			{
				"checkmark": 0,
				"status": "noob",
				"quote": "You're just a little newbie"
			}, 
			{
				"checkmark": 500,
				"status": "champion",
				"quote": "You're halfway there"
			}, 
			{
				"checkmark": 1000,
				"status": "legend",
				"quote": "You made it!"
			}
		]
	}
);
```

## Multipliers
Handy when you want to give your user double or triple points for a given duration.

```javascript
// multiply all increments and decrements by 2 from now on
score.multiplier(2);

// multiply all increments and decrements by 3 for the next 5 seconds
score.multiplier(3, 5000);

// multiply all increments and decrements by 4 for the next 5 seconds 
// with a callback
score.multiplier(4, 5000, function(){ ... });
```

## Prestige levels
To provide an infinite score, you can allow your players to reset their score after completing all levels. 

```javascript
score.prestige();
```
This resets the score to ```0``` and increments ```scorecard.prestige```. This only works if ```scorecard.totalprogress``` is 100%.
